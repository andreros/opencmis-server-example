# A repository connector has to extend the AbstractServiceFactory class. This class manages the objects that implement
# the CMIS service interface. There is only one active instance of this factory class per servlet context. The class
# name has to be set in the configuration file "/WEB-INF/classes/repository.properties".

# set fully qualified class name
class=com.opencmis.server.FileBridgeCmisServiceFactory

# repository properties
login.1 = test:test
login.2 = reader:reader

# Windows
repository.test = C:\\wamp\\www\\opencmis-server

# Unix
# repository.test = /

repository.test.readwrite = test
repository.test.readonly = reader
